                <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website.<br> My name is Maryam Abou El Lif, and I am currently a first-year Computer Engineering student at Epicode Institute of Technology in Milan, Italy. This website was developed as part of my university coursework, and it represents the first step in building my professional online presence.<br> This portfolio is designed to reflect my learning journey as I begin developing my technical skills in programming and web development. It is a space where I can document my progress, showcase what I am learning, and gradually build a collection of projects that demonstrate both my effort and growth. <br>Although I am at the start of my academic career, I am highly motivated and dedicated to improving my skills every day. From learning my first programming languages to creating my first website, each step has challenged me to think critically and work creatively. This portfolio will grow as I grow, evolving throughout my university experience.</p>

                                <p>My interest in technology began at a very young age. I was first introduced to computers as a child, and over time this exposure developed into a strong curiosity about how software systems work. While many people use computers simply as tools, I wanted to understand how everything running behind the screen was created. After graduating high school in 2023, I chose to pursue Computer Engineering at Epicode Institute of Technology in Milan, Italy. This decision was driven by my interest in combining logic, problem-solving, and creativity in one field. As a student, I am currently focused on building a strong foundational understanding of programming concepts and computing principles. At university, my coursework exposes me to both theoretical concepts and practical applications. I am learning how websites are structured, how software is written, and how code can be used to solve problems. Each subject contributes to my understanding of how technology operates on a larger scale. Outside of my academic life, I have a deep interest in creative fields such as music, fashion, and makeup. These interests influence the way I think about design, colors, and self-expression, which also reflect in how I approach creative technical work. I see my personality as a balance between creativity and structure, and I hope to build a career that allows me to use both. </p>

                                <p>Since I am still early in my academic journey, my career path is currently flexible. I am taking the time to explore different areas of technology to discover where my skills and interests are best suited. One of my key objectives is to work in a field that allows me to create something meaningful. Whether through software, websites, or future technologies, I want to be involved in building products that serve a purpose and bring value to others. I am particularly drawn to roles where I can combine technical thinking with creativity. Currently, I enjoy frontend development because it allows me to visually see the results of my work while strengthening my logical thinking skills. In the long term, I aim to gain experience in the workforce after completing my degree while continuing my education through advanced studies. I believe that combining academic knowledge with real-world experience will help me develop both professionally and personally.</p>
